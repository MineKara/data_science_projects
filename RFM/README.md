## Business Problem

<img align="right" width="400" src="rfm.jpg" />

FLO, an online shoe store, wants to divide its customers into segments and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. To this end, customers' behaviors will be defined and groups will be created based on clusters in these behaviors.

## Dataset

The data set consists of information obtained from the past shopping behavior of customers who made their last purchases from Flo via OmniChannel (both online and offline shopping) in 2020 - 2021.
